        <p><b>Ronaldo scored three goals as Portugal hammered hapless Lithuania.</b></p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is the best footballer in the world, his Portugal team-mate Mario Rui has claimed.</p>
      <p>It was Ronaldo's 55th career hat-trick and his ninth for the Selecao - and after the match Napoli full-back Rui insisted the 34-year-old remains the best in the world.</p>
      <p>"He is the best in the world, never tired of winning, wanting more, and it is this hunger that makes him what he is," the Napoli left-back said, via A Bola.
        "We are happy to have him on the team and I hope he will continue to give us joy as he has done so far." </p>
