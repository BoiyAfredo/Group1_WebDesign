      <p>There's arguably never been a better time than now to be a fan of anime. As a multi-billion dollar industry, the once-niche cultural export has morphed into a worldwide phenomenon, its impact and reach seen and felt in nearly every facet of contemporary animation. With as many options as are afforded to viewers nowadays -- not mention the decades-worth of content accessible through streaming services like Netflix and Hulu and Crunchyroll -- it's also never been trickier to keep up with all the new releases within a single year. Thereâ€™s so much that 2019 has to offer in the way of anime, from remakes of venerated contemporary and cult classics like Boogiepop and Others and Dororo, to hotly anticipated follow-up seasons to shows like Mob Psycho 100 and One Punch Man, to even more exciting upcoming releases in the way of a Bladerunner anime series directed by none other than Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the inimitable classic Cowboy Bebop. Instead of wasting your time on crappy new series, read this highly curated list of the best new anime of 2019. We'll be updating as the year rolls on, so check back frequently for new additions. </p>
